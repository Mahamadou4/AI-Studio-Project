## 🏗️Project Overview

Connection to Break Through Tech AI

This project was developed as part of the Break Through Tech AI Studio, where fellows work on real-world, industry-aligned data science challenges using enterprise platforms and responsible AI practices.

**Host Context & Objectives**

The objective of this project is to identify and explain healthcare access gaps (“medical deserts”) in Arizona by analyzing how social vulnerability, heat exposure, population dynamics, and hospital capacity interact at the county level. social vulnerability, heat exposure, population dynamics, and hospital capacity intersect at the county level.

**Scope of Work**
- Data exploration and feature engineering using Snowflake
- County-level comparative analysis and interactive visualization
- Interpretability-focused model evaluation
- AI-assisted insight generation for non-technical stakeholders

**Real-World Significance**

Extreme heat and social vulnerability amplify healthcare inequities. This dashboard helps:
- Public health officials prioritize intervention areas
- Policymakers allocate healthcare resources more effectively
- Communities prepare for climate-driven health risks

### 📊 Data Exploration
- Explored raw and engineered datasets directly from Snowflake
- Analyzed distributions, missing values, and county-level variation
- Identified patterns linking vulnerability, heat risk, and hospital access
- Used visual, interpretable EDA to support non-technical decision-makers


### 🧠 Model Development
- Evaluated multiple models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest)
- Focused on interpretability over complexity
- Observed perfect scores due to small dataset size and clear signal
- Explicitly discussed risks of overfitting and data leakage
	

### 📈 Results & Key Findings
- All evaluated models achieved perfect precision and recall on the dataset
- Results indicate a strong, easily separable pattern rather than robust generalization
- High-risk counties consistently show overlap between social vulnerability, heat exposure, and limited healthcare capacity


### 🤖 AI Usage
- Integrated an AI Assistant powered by Snowflake Cortex
- Enables natural-language questions about counties, vulnerability, and healthcare access
- Designed for explainability and decision support, not automated decision-making
- No external API keys required

### ⚖️ Responsible AI Considerations
- County-level aggregation may hide within-county disparities
- Small sample size limits generalizability
- Perfect model performance flagged as a red flag, not a success metric
- Outputs are intended to support human judgment, not replace it

### 🚀 Next Steps
- Expand datasets beyond Arizona
- Add cross-validation and temporal analysis
- Integrate geospatial mapping layers
- Evaluate external validation data
- Cross-validation with expanded datasets
- Time-series heat analysis  
- External validation beyond Arizona
- Geospatial mapping layers
